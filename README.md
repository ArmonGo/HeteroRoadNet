# HeteroRoadNet: A Heterogenous Road-based Graph Neural Network Approach for Property Price Prediction

**Abstract:** Geospatial inference plays a pivotal role in applications such as real estate valuation. However, the complexity of spatial dependencies and the heterogeneity of data makes this a challenging task. Existing techniques often struggle to effectively exploit and integrate diverse geospatial entities whilst maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph-based framework, HeteroRoadNet, which adaptively integrates roads, target locations, and Points of Interest (POIs) in an end-to-end graph neural network architecture. Our approach employs Steiner tree approximations and subgraph extraction techniques to enhance scalability and improve performance in geospatial inference tasks. We validate the efficiency of our framework through estate price prediction across diverse geospatial locations, comparing various models under different levels of feature expansion, and demonstrate its superior performance across all comparisons.
